Making your Django app work in multiple languages might sound daunting, but it doesn’t have to be. Django already comes with robust internationalization features, and tools like [yesglot](https://github.com/efe/yesglot), an AI‑powered translator I built for developers, make the process even smoother. In this presentation, we will explore the essentials of internationalization, highlight some lesser‑known tricks and show how yesglot can speed up translations so your app is ready for a global audience. Whether you are just getting started or have shipped Django projects before, you will find practical strategies you can apply right away.

I presented this topic as “Multilingual Django Applications with a sprinkle of AI” at [PyCon Greece 2025](https://pretalx.com/pycongr25/talk/AV8QYF/), held in Athens on August 30, 2025.
